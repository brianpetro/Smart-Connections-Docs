Smart Environments are a core component of the Smart Connect app, designed to provide seamless integration between your local notes and AI-powered processing. By defining which files are accessible and how they are processed, Smart Environments empower users to interact with their data in a more intelligent and personalized manner. Whether you’re managing your knowledge base, syncing content from Obsidian, or excluding specific sections from processing, Smart Environments offer flexible configuration options tailored to your needs.
